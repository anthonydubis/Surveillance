Surveillance is an iOS app that is meant to turn your iOS device into a
surveillance camera. As of this writing, it will provide the following
functionality:

1. Watch an area and detect any motion in view.
2. When motion is detected, begin recording.
3. While recording, try to detect faces in the frame.
4. If a face is detected, try to match the face against a library of "known"
faces (presumably friends).

This app is being developed for a course called Visual Interfaces to
Computers at Columbia University (Spring 2015).
